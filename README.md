## Tokenizer Project

Aims to shift the understanding about encryption being used inside scripting to concerve and pause programs;
and create a type of checkpoint stopping the software if authentication is not passed. 

this stops the program and creates a checkpoint while inside the runtime code
preventing the enviornment from loading the next part or block file.

Each block file contains new texture information for while loading.
